# RSI Analysis Program

DESCRIPTION: This program is a Relative Strength Index Tool.

OVERVIEW: The user enters a ticker code for a stock (e.g. GLD, TSLA) and a start date, then the program will use yahoo finance to retrieve the RSI data
for that stock, from the start date provided, to the current date. The program will then give the user that information in a graphical representation using the matplotlib library. 

  
Libraries:  
- tkinter
- tkcalendar
- yfinance (yahoo finance)
- pandas
- pandas_datareader
- datetime
- matplotlib.pyplot

Sudoku Puzzle ðŸ§©
=============

Sudoku puzzle solver and playable console game. Created using .NET and C#.

Features
--------

-   Solver: A Sudoku solver using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
    - The recursive backtracking algorithm systematically fills Sudoku cells, exploring valid digit choices for each empty cell, backtracking when necessary until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
-   Board Creation: Boards are created based on the difficulty level provided by the user.
    - First, random numbers are placed throughout the board to ensure each puzzle created differs from the last. The board is then solved, where a set amount of cells is set back to 0 based on the difficulty level. 
-   Game Mode: An interactive game mode that allows you to play the generated Sudoku puzzles.
    - The board is interacted with via coordinates, where 0's represent empty cells. Instructions are included to assist users in playing the game.
-   Cell Checking: Cell checking to identify invalid cells by comparing them to the solved board.
